I am an academically trained data scientist working on my Ph.D. at Data Analytic Research Group, Macquarie University, Sydney, Australia.

Very passionate to take complex data and find patterns to answer the desired question in business and industry. Strong believer of the team working, positive, hard worker, creative and flexible. 

Currently, my research focus is on big data analytics, specifically big data summarization, where it is required to employ novel supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms to find a solution in various fields.
